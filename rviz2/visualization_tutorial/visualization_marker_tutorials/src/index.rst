Visualization Marker Tutorials
==============================

The visualization marker tutorials will show you how to use the Marker Display in RViz to render basic shapes and lines.
These primitive objects can be sent to the display through `visualization_msgs/msg/Marker` messages.

- :doc:`basic_shapes` shows how to send cubes, spheres, cylinders, and arrows to RViz.

- :doc:`points_and_lines` shows how to send points and lines to RViz.
